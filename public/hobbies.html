        <p>If I have some free time and I have nothing to do Video Editing comes first to my mind since it's been my hobby to edit ever since middle-school. I once dreamed about being a youtuber when I was a kid and when I first came across in editing I was hooked about the various tools that you can work with. I mostly edit when I hit an amazing clip when I play a specific game, anime amvs where there's some transitions and special effects, and I love editing cinematic vids or short films.</p>

        <p>And of course, it is something that I can't take off my list is playing online games. It's actually my stress reliever whenever I play games with my friends, winning and losing together is definitely the best part of gaming with friends.</p>

        <h2>Listening to music</h2>

        <p>Listening to music is my escape to reality and it soothes me whenever I feel nervous or when I have anxiety attacks.</p>
